# Save progress frequently
git stash push -m "PROGRESS: [what you're working on]"
```

### **3. Testing Changes**
```bash
# Test your changes

## 🎨 **For Future Design Changes**

### **Recommended Approach**
1. **Create Checkpoint**: `git commit -m "CHECKPOINT: Working system"`
2. **Create Feature Branch**: `git checkout -b feature/modern-design`
3. **Make Changes**: Work on one portal at a time
4. **Test Each Portal**: Ensure it works before moving to next
5. **Merge When Ready**: `git checkout master && git merge feature/modern-design`

### **Safe Design Update Process**
```bash
# 1. Checkpoint current state
git add -A && git commit -m "CHECKPOINT: All portals working"

# 2. Create design branch
git checkout -b design/modern-ui

# 3. Update one portal at a time
# Test each portal individually

# 4. If something breaks:
git checkout master  # Go back to working version

# 5. If everything works:
git checkout master && git merge design/modern-ui
```

## 📞 **Emergency Recovery**

### **If System Completely Breaks**
```bash
# Nuclear option - restore to last known good state
git reset --hard HEAD
git clean -fd
git checkout master
```

### **If You Need the Modern Dashboard Code**
```bash
# The modern dashboard code is safely stored in stash
git stash apply stash@{0}
# Then copy the files you need before reverting again
```
