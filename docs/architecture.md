# TRACE HERB System Architecture

## Overview

The TRACE HERB system is designed as a multi-tier architecture that combines blockchain technology with modern web and mobile applications to provide end-to-end traceability for Ayurvedic herbs.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Presentation Layer
- **Consumer Portal**: Web-based QR code scanning interface
- **Stakeholder Dashboard**: Management interface for supply chain participants
- **Mobile DApp**: Optimized for rural collectors with offline capabilities
- **SMS Gateway**: Text-based interface for areas with limited connectivity

### 2. Application Layer
- **API Gateway**: RESTful services for all client interactions
- **Authentication Service**: JWT-based authentication with role management
- **Notification Service**: Real-time alerts and updates
- **Reporting Service**: Analytics and compliance reporting

### 3. Business Logic Layer
- **Smart Contracts**: Automated validation and enforcement
- **Data Processing**: FHIR-style metadata handling
- **Geo-fencing Engine**: Location-based validation
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated quality gate validations

### 4. Data Layer
- **Blockchain Network**: Hyperledger Fabric for immutable records
- **Off-chain Database**: CouchDB for performance optimization
- **File Storage**: IPFS for large documents and images
- **Cache Layer**: Redis for frequently accessed data

## Network Topology

### Blockchain Network Participants

1. **Farmers/Collectors Node**
   - Role: Record collection events
   - Permissions: Write collection data, read own records

2. **Processing Facilities Node**
   - Role: Record processing steps
   - Permissions: Write processing data, read supply chain data

3. **Testing Laboratories Node**
   - Role: Record quality test results
   - Permissions: Write test data, read related batch data

4. **Manufacturers Node**
   - Role: Record formulation and packaging
   - Permissions: Write product data, read all upstream data

5. **Regulatory Node**
   - Role: Monitor compliance and auditing
   - Permissions: Read all data, write compliance records

6. **Ordering Service**
   - Role: Transaction ordering and consensus
   - Type: Raft-based ordering service

## Data Flow Architecture

```
Collection Event → Processing Step → Quality Test → Formulation → Consumer Scan
      ↓               ↓               ↓              ↓              ↓
   GPS Data      Processing Data   Lab Results   Product Data   Provenance
      ↓               ↓               ↓              ↓              ↓
  Smart Contract Validation → Blockchain Ledger → Consumer Portal
```

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- Multi-factor authentication for all participants
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API key management for system integrations
- Digital certificates for blockchain network access

### Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Hash-based data integrity verification
- Private data collections for confidential information
- Audit trails for all system access

### Network Security
- TLS encryption for all communications
- VPN access for blockchain network
- Firewall rules and network segmentation
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Microservices architecture for independent scaling
- Load balancers for API gateway
- Database sharding for large datasets
- CDN for static content delivery

### Performance Optimization
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Asynchronous processing for heavy operations
- Database indexing for query optimization
- Connection pooling for database access

## Integration Points

### External Systems
- ERP system integration via REST APIs
- Laboratory information systems (LIMS)
- Government regulatory databases
- Third-party logistics systems

### Standards Compliance
- FHIR-style metadata bundles
- GS1 standards for product identification
- ISO 27001 for information security
- AYUSH Ministry guidelines compliance

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment
- Local Hyperledger Fabric network
- Docker containers for all services
- Hot reload for development efficiency

### Staging Environment
- Multi-node blockchain network
- Load testing and performance validation
- Security testing and vulnerability assessment

### Production Environment
